I was playing with the AppleTV (4th gen) the other day and accidentally triggered one of the developer tools, so I poked around a bit more & came up with the following combos.

## The below are all done from the home screen

### Play/Pause -- hold for a few seconds

* This will allow you to change audio output, this is helpful for switching to a previously paired set of bluetooth headphones. Found this one via [johsherrod.net](https://johnsherrod.net/how-to-quickly-switch-audio-to-bluetooth-headphones-on-apple-tv-5084558a164f)

### Play/Pause + Volume Down

* Hold for 3 seconds & release -- This will save a "stackshot", this is ued by developers for troubleshooting apps.
* Hold for 6 seconds & release -- Will create analytics & allow them to be shared (via air drop)

### Play/Pause + Volume Up

* Hold for 10 seconds & release -- This will presumably take a screenshot. You can hear the screenshot sound, but I have not figured out where the screenshots end up.

### Menu + volume up

* Start remote pairing mode

### Menu + volume down

* Autoscan for new output settings

### Home + volume up

* Hold for about 10 seconds & then release -- send diagnostic logs to Apple

### Play + Menu

* Hold for about 10 seconds -- force a reboot
