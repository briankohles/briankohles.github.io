<p>One of the things I was looking for in a blog was an easy way to post code in assorted languages. This could range from a quick command line I want to remember, or a larger script I've written.

While looking for good Ghost themes, I found one that had an embedded [Gist](http://gist.github.org) and I realized this was the best way to go. Not only could I store all my code/snippets in one easy to get to place, but I could easily embed those snippets in my blog posts, and gist would handle all of the formatting.

For example here is some embedded markdown:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/briankohles/8702971.js"></script></p>
