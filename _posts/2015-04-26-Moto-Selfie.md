My first ride to an actual destination. Took the bike out to Moraine View State Park. It actually turned out to be several firsts today:

* first real "adventure" trip (more than just riding around the city/commuting)
* first ride to a state park
* first ride on gravel road (very heavily rutted)
* first ride on grated asphalt
* first selfie with the motorcycle
