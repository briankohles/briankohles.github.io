I’ve had a few people at the trailhead comment on the trailer lights I put on my hitch mounted rack so I thought I’d do up a quick post about the parts/process

## Parts
* A pair of trailer lights. I use this set due to the low profile.
	* [Kai Tai Waterproof Red 17 Inch Tail LED Light Bar (Pair)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0069TND14/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_sAbGzbHPNN4CT) -
$25
* Trailer wiring & connector
	* [Wesbar 707261 Wishbone Style Trailer Wiring Harness with 4-Flat Connector](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AYFTV/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_dFbGzbRVDCGRZ) - $13
 * Waterproof butt crimp connectors
 * Right angle brackets
 * Bolts & Nuts (for connecting light bars to brackets)
 * Self tapping metal screws (for connecting brackets to rack)
 * Shrink wrap tubing
 * Corragated plastic wire wrap (to make it all look pretty)
 
 ## Wiring Diagram
 
The first step is to wire the lights up temporarily to make sure all the connections are correct.

There is a good wiring info table on eTrailer: [https://www.etrailer.com/faq-wiring.aspx](Wiring FAQ) this is where I found the info for the below.
 
There are 5 wires coming off the wiring harness:
* White - ground to rack
* Brown/Green - Tail/marker
* Brown - Tail/marker
* Yellow - Left Turn
* Green - Right Turn

Each light has 3 Wires:
* White - ground to rack
* Green - Turn
* Black - Tail/marker

The wiring is easy just follow the below diagram. For the brown wires just use the brown to one light & the brown/green to the other, it doesn’t matter which goes to which.
