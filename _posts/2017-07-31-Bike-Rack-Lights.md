I’ve had a few people at the trailhead comment on the trailer lights I put on my hitch mounted rack so I thought I’d do up a quick post about the parts/process.

While writing this post I had the idea that using an LED light strip (like the kind they put below the tailgate on a truck), might be a cheaper and easier solution. Which it turns out it is. I can’t vouch for this type of install, but I have used similar lights on my motorcycle with no issues. So maybe save some time and money & have a look @ these:

## Parts
* A pair of trailer lights. I use this set due to the low profile.

 * Waterproof butt crimp connectors
 * Right angle brackets
 * Bolts & Nuts (for connecting light bars to brackets)
 * Self tapping metal screws (for connecting brackets to rack)
 * Shrink wrap tubing
 * Corragated plastic wire wrap (to make it all look pretty)
 
## Wiring Diagram
 
The first step is to wire the lights up temporarily to make sure all the connections are correct.

There is a good wiring info table on eTrailer: [https://www.etrailer.com/faq-wiring.aspx](Wiring FAQ) this is where I found the info for the below.
 
There are 5 wires coming off the wiring harness:
* White - ground to rack
* Brown/Green - Tail/marker
* Brown - Tail/marker
* Yellow - Left Turn
* Green - Right Turn

Each light has 3 Wires:
* White - ground to rack
* Green - Turn
* Black - Tail/marker

The wiring is easy just follow the below diagram. For the brown wires just use the brown to one light & the brown/green to the other, it doesn’t matter which goes to which.
