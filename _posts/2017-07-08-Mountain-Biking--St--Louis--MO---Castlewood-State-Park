We were planning to go over to Griffin Park Bike Park in Terre Haute Indiana, but it got rained out the night before. Instead we ended up going to Castlerock State Park a little west of St. Louis.

There are three trail systems in the area, that are linked together:

1. Castlewood State Park
2. West Tyson County Park
3. Rock Hollow

Sadly we didn't have the time to do more than one park, so we only saw Castlewood today.

We did luck out and there happened to be a demo day for [Niner Bikes](http://www.ninerbikes.com/), due to this I got to take a Rip 9 RDO out for a spin through the trails. It's the first time I've gotten to take a full suspension bike off road. The bike was very nice & handled well going up or down hill with ease. Unfortunately its $6600 price tag puts it a little outside my budget.

Overall it was a great place to ride and I'm sure there will be other (better planned) trips out there in the future where we will ride more of the trails.
