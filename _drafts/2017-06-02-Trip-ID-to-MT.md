## Day 1 - Thursday
**Drive:** Bloomington, IL -> Lincoln, NE

Just driving today, nothing exciting. We hit the road about 3:30pm & got to the hotel around midnight.


## Day 2 - Friday
**Drive:** Lincoln, NE -> Rock Springs, WY

Just driving again today.

Talked to mom, going to meet her tomorrow for brunch when we pass through Ogden.

We did see a cool old Jeep Truck today, at the place we stopped for dinner in Rawlings, Wyoming.

We arrived at the hotel fairly early tonight, at around 7pm. We didn't have anything planned in Rock Springs so we just went straight to the hotel & got to bed early.


## Day 3 - Saturday
**Drive:** Rock Springs, WY -> Tamarack Resort, ID

The drive to Tamarack took a very long time through lots of little towns, and twisty turny mountain roads. On the way we did pass through Boise, ID.

**Stop:** [Meriwether Cider Co](http://www.meriwethercider.com)

On the way we stopped at Meriwether Cider Co in Boise, CO

It wasn’t too late when we got to the lodge. We got settled & met with some of the wedding party for dinner.


## Day 4 - Sunday
**Stay:** Tamarack Resort, ID

Went for a jog/walk with Sherri in the morning along the golf course. Didn't look like it's actually open for any golfing, but it was a nice view, and a good place for a run.

Afterwards we went for a bike ride around some of the golf course.

Then I went for a bike ride on my own after Sherri went back to the room. Got to do some great cross country biking in actual mountains. It was very scenic, and very easy going.

## Day 5 - Monday
**Drive:** Tamarack Resort, ID -> Taft, MT
  * Adventure: Ride the Route of the Hiawatha Trail
  * Drive: Taft, MT -> West Glacier National Park, MT

Woke up early for the drive to Taft MT to ride the Route of the Hiawatha trail.

Spent the afternoon riding down the trail. It took a very long time to get there but the trail was incredibly scenic. If you enjoy riding rail trails or great scenery this is a must do activity if you are within a days drive of northern Idaho

<!-- END MTB Project -->

**Drive:** Taft, MT -> Glacier National Park

The drive to Glacier National Park, was also a very long, but scenic drive. It was a little odd at times. There were stretches of road where we didn’t see anything or anyone for 30 minutes. But it was vast and beautiful scenery.

I'm not sure how I calculated the drive times so wrong. I thought it was only 3 hours to Hiawatha & then another 3 to glacier. It was actually about 7 to Hiawatha & then 3.5ish to glacier.

We got up @ 6am & are now just getting to bed at 12:30.


## Day 6 - Tuesday
**Stay:** Glacier National Park, MT

First day in Glacier

We slept in, got out of the room for breakfast at 9:30, and then went for a hike.

<iframe src="http://my.viewranger.com/route/widget/MTAzMzc0?locale=en&amp;m=miles" width="640" height="640" marginwidth="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

We ended up doing the Avalanche trail up to Avalanche Lake it was a good hike, I recorded the trip down in Run Keeper. It came in at 2.99 miles so just about 6 miles round trip.

The lake was beautiful with a great mountain backdrop and waterfalls of snow melt pouring down the mountain.

We saw some deer on the hike, but no bear. There was talk of grizzlies at the lake, but we only heard this after we were heading back down, and I think they were on the far shore so I don’t think we’d have been able to really see them anyway.

Later in the evening we did go out for a short drive and saw a black bear just off the road, then saw more deer later on.

During our evening drive we saw a HUGE pack of ADV bikes, almost all BMW GS1200s, it really made me want to get in some really long saddle time. Need to spend some time planning a trip or two. Need to look into some gear to make camping viable & try that out up @ Comlara Park. Also need to lookup what this ride was, and come to a decision about what motorcycle to get next. Or how to mod my bike into what I want.


## Day 7 - Wednesday
**Stay:** Glacier National Park, MT

Second day in Glacier.

We got up & going fairly early. We drove up to where Going-To-The-Sun-Road is closed (at Avalanche campground & trail), and biked the closed section of the road.

This was an amazing bike ride it was so cool to be able to bike on such a beautiful stretch of road and not have to worry about cars. This is a thing we are going to need to look for in the future when we are doing vacations.

The view was jaw dropping the whole way there. We saw a few deer, but no bears.

The total ride was 16.9 miles, and Sherri did the entire thing. It was great to be able to do this ride with her.

Near the end of the ride (maybe ¾ of the way up) there was a short tunnel, which had two or three arches looking out over the valley, water was streaming down over the front of the arches. I took a brief shower in the water. Being glacial melt it was incredibly cold, but also very refreshing.

After our ride we went to some small shops & had lunch out, and stopped by the Apgar visitor center.

We also stopped and booked a whitewater rafting trip for tomorrow @ 1:30pm, Sherri said she would much rather raft than do kayaking on the lake, and that sounded like a better plan to me so I went with it.

In the evening we walked over to the little camp store & got a bottle of cold cider & some wines for later, then we went and sat out in the shade by the lake to enjoy a relaxing evening. After the bugs got too bad we retreated inside to enjoy the lodge for a while before bed.


## Day 8 - Thursday
**Stay:** Glacier National Park, MT
  * Adventure: White water rafting

Last day in Glacier, leaving early tomorrow morning.

Today we got up and went down for the breakfast buffet again.

After breakfast we did a short hike of the John's Lake Loop Trail. This was an easy hike of only about 3 miles, but it went through some good views we hadn't done before.

After hiking we got ready for our rafting trip, it was a good trip, but it only took an hour & 15 minutes for the whole run due to how much water was flowing. It was a great time, but way too short.

In the evening I went out and shot some pictures of the area.


## Day 9 - Friday
**Drive:** Glacier NP, MT -> Bismark, ND

Stopped at Tongue River Winery, they had a lot of good wines and we ended up leaving with a case.

Checked into the hotel for the night, in Bismark, ND. Upon seeing my license the front Desk person commented “Oh, we've had a lot of people from the east coast today”, it was around midnight so I had no energy to give them a geography lesson.


## Day 10 - Saturday
**Drive:** Bismark, ND -> Bloomington , IL

Nothing exciting to report on this leg. Only that it was good to be home. We will definitely be going back to Glacier at some point, and staying longer. Hopefully we can see all the sections of the park & get in some longer hikes.
