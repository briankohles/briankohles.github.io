# HomePod, the best Car audio experience

What if the HomePod is just a playground for Apple to work on some really sweet car audio tech?

The HomePod is designed so that it has an array of microphones, and an array of speakers. The output to the speakers is based on input from the microphones, which is used to determine the size/layout of the room.

What if this same method was applied to a car stereo?

Not only could the stereo adjust based on the music being played, it could adjust based on how many people are in the car, if the windows are up/down, or if the top is up/down.
